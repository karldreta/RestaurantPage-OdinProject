# restaurant-page-odin-project
This is an Odin Project: Restaurant Page


## [The Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page): Restaurant Page


## Objective

* Manipulate the DOM using as little HTML as possible, and mostly JavaScript. 
    * Note: DOM elements should be created using JavaScript but       styling can be done in a separate CSS file.

* I am expected to utilize [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for bundling data throughout this project.

* Use Loaders to Load assets

* Modularize the code base using [ES6 Modules](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-es6-modules)
