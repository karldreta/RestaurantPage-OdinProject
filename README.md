# Restaurant Page - Odin Project
This is the project for [Odin Project: Restaurant Page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page).


## Objective

* Manipulate the DOM using mostly JavaScript with minimal HTML. 
* Note: DOM elements should be created using JavaScript but       styling can be done in a separate CSS file.

* Utilize [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for bundling assets throughout the project.

* Use Loaders to Load assets

* Modularize the code base using [ES6 Modules](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-es6-modules)


## Finished the Project

* Although I didn't spend as much time as I could have, I achieved the main objectives.

* Additional features like a contact form for the contact tab could be added in the future.

* I learned valuable skills, such as positioning a background image to cover the entire page dynamically. 


## Skills Acquired

* Code base modularization
* File structure organization
* Webpack asset management
* DOM manipulation using JavaScript
